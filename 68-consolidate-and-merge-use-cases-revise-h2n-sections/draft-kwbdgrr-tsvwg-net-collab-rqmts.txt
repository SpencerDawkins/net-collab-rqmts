            Requirements for Network Collaboration Signaling
              draft-kwbdgrr-tsvwg-net-collab-rqmts-latest

Abstract

   Wireless networks experience significant but transient variations in
   link quality that affect user experience.

   Collaborative signaling from host-to-network and server-to-network
   can improve the user experience by informing the network about the
   nature and relative importance of packets (frames, streams, etc.)
   without having to disclose the content of the packets.  Moreover, the
   collaborative signalling may be enabled so that hosts are aware of
   the network's treatment of incoming packets.  Also, host-to-network
   collaboration can be put in place without revealing the identity of
   the remote servers.  This collaboration allows for differentiated
   services at the network (e.g., packet discard preference), the sender
   (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of server /
   host and the network.

   This document lists some use cases that illustrate the need for a
   mechanism to share metadata and outlines requirements for both host-
   to-network and server-to-network.  The document focuses on intra-flow
   or flows bound to the same user.

1.  Introduction

   Wireless networks including 5G and WLAN inherently experience large
   variations in link quality over sub-RTT intervals and on the other
   hand applications such as interactive media demand both low latency
   and high bandwidth.  Maximizing network utilization and end user
   experience under such conditions is challenging.  Factors that affect
   wireless networks include change in channel conditions, interference
   between proximate cells and end user movement.  These variations in
   link quality can be in the order of a millisecond or less [_5G-Lumos]
   while congestion control takes several tens of milliseconds (more
   than one round-trip time (RTT)) to estimate data rate.  Similarly,
   application servers that encode and serve live or interactive media
   take time to adjust the encoding level and other processes to match
   the network rate.  End-to-end congestion control algorithms are far
   from being optimal when the link quality is highly variable in sub-
   RTT timeframes and the application demands both low latency and high
   bandwidth (e.g., Section 2.1 of [RFC6077]).  In these conditions,
   applications settle for a lower throughput when latency is
   prioritized, or for higher throughput at the expense of much higher
   delays.

   While rate control based on feedback for a flow (UDP 4-tuple) is
   evidently not able adapt for sub-RTT changes in available wireless
   channel resources, the application server can provide information on
   a per-packet basis that a network shaper may use to utilize the
   available resources more effectively. [_5G-Octopus] has shown for
   volumetric video packets and a rate controller that errs on the side
   of overestimation, that the network shaper can drop low priority
   frames of a group of pictures (corresponding to transient wireless
   link bandwidth drops) and still achieve significantly better
   performance than state-of-the-art based on feedback.  With not fully
   encrypted packets, networks may use heuristics to build an "implicit
   signal" gleaned from a packet to prioritize or otherwise shape flows.
   However, implicit signals are not desirable as they lead to
   ossification of protocols as result of introducing unintended
   dependencies [RFC9419].  When packet contents are encrypted, the
   approach of using implicit signals is no longer viable.

   Bandwidth constraints exist most predominantly at the access network
   (e.g., radio access networks).  Users who are serviced via these
   networks use hosts which run various application clients; each having
   different connectivity needs for an optimal user experience.  These
   needs are not frozen but change over time depending on the
   application and even depending on how an application is used (e.g.,
   user's preferences).  An explicit signal to the host can help to
   manage the use of available bandwidth better and better share it with
   requesting applications.

   Other applications like interactive media can demand both high
   throughput and low latency and, in some cases, carry different
   streams (e.g., audio and video) in a single transport connection
   (e.g., WebRTC [RFC8825]).  There may be preferences that an
   application may wish to convey, such as a higher priority for audio
   over video (or the opposite) in congested networks or importance of
   certain packets (e.g., video key frames).  With RTP [RFC3550], the
   media type could be examined and used as an implicit signal for
   determining relative priority.  However, [RFC9335] defines a new
   mechanism that completely encrypts RTP header extensions and
   Contributing sources (CSRCs).  Furthermore, a full encrypted
   transport (e.g., QUIC [RFC9000]) does not expose any media header
   information that on-path network elements can use for forwarding
   decisions.

   Figure 1 shows where such bandwidth and performance constraints
   usually exist with a "B" (for Bottleneck) in 3GPP/mobile networks and
   WLAN/ISP networks.  When a bottleneck exists temporarily, the network
   has no choice but to discard or delay packets -- which can harm
   certain flows and, thus, lead to suboptimal perceived experience.  In
   this document, this is termed 'reactive policy'.

                                  Figure 2

   Figure 2 shows a bottleneck (access) router on the path of packets
   from Server to Client.  A network shaper in the router manages QoS of
   flows of multiple users and can buffer (delay), discard, or apply
   other flow control rules.  Application layer signaling and feedback
   between Client – Server (A – in the figure) adjust transmission rate
   over a period of several RTTs using feedback and congestion control
   algorithms.  Congestion control algorithms are generally conservative
   and settle to a steady rate that avoids excessive packet loss.  In
   networks where link conditions (between Client and Router) vary
   significantly at timescales well below the RTT, this results in
   unused (wasted) bandwidth at short timescales.  There is some
   research [_5G-Octopus] to indicate that media applications can obtain
   better QoE when sending at a higher rate (less conservative than
   current CCA) and the media application is willing to tolerate some
   packet loss or delay of low priority packets.  Packet priority and
   tolerance to delay of packets in such a case would be provided on-
   path in a side channel associated to the downstream packet (B – in
   figure).  The requirements for this server-to-network (S2N) metadata
   are described in Section 5.2.  Network shapers observe flows and
   apply policies to maximize performance but are not aware whether
   there is a high preference for one flow (UDP 4-tuple) over another
   flow belonging to the same user and network attachment (e.g., a
   subscriber connection, a 3GPP PDU Session.  See Appendix A for more
   details).  Clients may provide an (access) router with preferences of
   which flow (UDP 4-tuple) has relative priority among flows of that
   network attachment using H2N (C - in Figure).  Clients may also
   provide information to an (access) router to drop, when resources are
   congested, 'lower priority'-marked packets of a flow (UDP 4-tuple)
   temporarily which can in turn allocate bandwidth to other flows of
   that same network attachment.

   In summary, the rapid variation of wireless link quality and/or
   bandwidth limitations in networks along with interactive applications
   that demand low latency and high throughput can lead to suboptimal
   user experience.  Section 3 outlines use cases to illustrate the
   issues and the need for additional information per flow to allow the
   network to optimize its handling.

   Some of the complications that are induced by the phenomena discussed
   above may be eliminated by adequate dimensioning and upgrades.
   However, such upgrades may not be always (immediately) possible or
   justified.  Complementary mitigations are thus needed to soften these
   complications by introducing some collaboration between endpoints and
   networks to adjust their behaviors.

   Section 4 provides operational constraints in the network and
   Section 5 describes the requirements for on-path media collaboration
   signals.

2.  Definitions

   The document makes use of the following terms:

   Discard preference:  Is an indication of drop preference within a
      flow when there are no sufficient network resources to handle all
      competing packets of that same flow.

   Intentional Management:  Network policy such as (monthly) bandwidth
      quota or bandwidth limit, or quality (delay and/or jitter))
      assurances.

   Reactive Management:  Network reactions to congestion events or
      protection polices under attacks, with very short to very long
      durations (e.g., varying wireless and mobile air interface
      conditions).

   Traffic shaping:  Refers in this document to QoS management at the
      wireless/access router to delay or discard packets of lower
      priority to achieve bounded latency and high throughput.

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Streaming and Interactive Media

   Streaming media packets carry audio or video between servers and
   clients.  Video packets carry the occasional key frame ("I-frame")
   containing a full video frame.  These frames are necessary to rebuild
   receiver state after loss of delta frames.  The key frames are
   therefore more critical to deliver to the receiver than delta frames.
   Audio is more critical than video for many applications, but its
   importance (relative to other packets in the flow) is still an
   application decision.  Examples include live broadcast and on-demand
   video streaming.

   Interactive media includes content that a user can actively engage
   with and results in input and response actions that can be highly
   delay-sensitive.  Examples include VoIP (Peer-to-Peer (P2P), group
   conferencing), gaming and eXtended Reality (XR).

   During congestion or other reactive policy events, retransmissions
   cause long delays.  All packets being treated the same can have
   challenges in efficiently handling/forwarding data.  Today, there is
   no way to identify packets which are less important and/or loss-
   tolerant to prioritize packets in challenging networks and/or during
   reactive events.  Some media frames may be able to tolerate more
   delay over the wire than others (e.g., live media frames require very
   low latency while a background image for augmented reality may be
   delivered with more delay tolerance).  Even when the media payload is
   not encrypted, the network has no means to distinguish these
   different requirements.

   Requirements:

   REQ-PACKET-PRIORITY: Packet priority relative to other packets within
   the same transport flow (UDP 4-tuple).  REQ-PACKET-DELAY: Metadata to
   indicate whether a packet can tolerate delay.

3.2.  Mixed-Traffic and User Preferences

   Some content is more resilient to buffering and delays (e.g., file
   copy, file download) compared to interactive traffic.  This traffic
   can be buffered in favor of improved interactivity, without
   significant impact to the user experience.  For example, an on-going
   file copy operation flow (UDP 4-tuple) of a remote desktop user can
   tolerate more delay than the flow carrying graphics updates.  Or, a
   user application flow downloading software updates in the background
   can tolerate more delay than a foreground application flow.

   This applies only when data is sent in different flows (UDP 4-tuples)
   that belong to the same network attachment (see Appendix A for
   details).

   Requirements:

   REQ-FLOW-DELAY: The receiving client determines tolerance to delay of
   flows (UDP-4 tuple) within the same network attachment.

   In other cases, a game or VoIP application may want to signal
   priority of one flow (UDP 4-tuple) over another flow.  For example,
   for a game, video in the server-to-client direction might be more
   important than audio, whereas input devices (e.g., keystrokes) might
   be more important than audio.  Each user can have varied preferences
   for the same type of data originating from the server.

   This applies only when data is sent in different flows (UDP 4-tuples)
   that belong to the same network attachment (see Appendix A for
   details).

   Requirements:

   REQ-FLOW-PRIORITY: The receiving client determines importance of
   flows (UDP-4 tuple) within the same network attachment.

4.  Operational Considerations

   Traffic policing and shaping are enforced in ingress/egress network
   points for various reasons (protect the network against attacks,
   ensure conformance with a trafic profile, etc.).  Out-of-profile
   trafic may be discarded or assigned another class (e.g., using Lower
   Effort Per-Domain Behavior (LE PDB) [RFC3662]) a bandwidth limit
   among others.  The exact behavior is policy-based and deployment-
   specific.

   The entire set of operations to manage traffic is beyond the scope of
   this document.  This section focuses on operational constraints that
   impact server – network, and host – network modes of sending
   metadata.

4.1.  Policy Enforcement

   Some metadata requires the network to share some hints with a host to
   adjust its behavior for some specific flows.  However, that metadata
   may have a dependency on the service offering that is subscribed by a
   user.

   Let us consider the example of a bitrate for an optimized video
   delivery. _Such bitrate may not be computed system-wide_ given that
   flows from users with distinct service offerings (and connectivity
   SLOs) may be serviced by the same network nodes.  Instead, the
   network needs to dynamically adjust the bitrate based on each user's
   service package and connectivity SLOs to ensure optimal delivery for
   all users (REQ-METADATA-ACCURACY).

   Requirement: REQ-METADATA-ACCURACY.

4.2.  Redundant Functions and Classification Complications

   If distinct channels are used to share the metadata between a host
   and a network, a network that engages in the collaborative signaling
   approach will require sophisticated features to classify flows and
   decide which channel is used to share metadata so that it can consume
   that information.

   Likewise, the network will require to implement redundant functions;
   for each signaling interface.

   _As such, application- and protocol-specific signaling channels are
   suboptimal._ (REQ-SINGLE-CHANNEL)

   Requirement: REQ-SINGLE-CHANNEL is preferred.

4.3.  Metadata Scope

   An operational challenge for sharing resource-quota like metadata
   (e.g., maximum bitrate) is that the network is generally not entitled
   to allocate quota per-application, per-flow, per-stream, etc. that
   delivered as part of an Internet connectivity service.  However, the
   network has a visibility about the overall network attachment (e.g.
   inbound/outbound bandwidth discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit]).

   As such, hints about resource-like metadata is bound by default to
   the overall network attachment, not specific to a given application
   or flow.

   Most importantly, the metadata can be used by the network to
   prioritize traffic within a single 5-tuple connection and metadata
   cannot be leveraged for prioritization between different flows.

   It is out of the scope of this document to discuss setups (e.g., 3GPP
   PDU Sessions) where network attachments with Guaranteed Bit Rate
   (GBR) for specific flows is provided.

   Requirement:

   REQ-SCOPED-METADATA:  Means to characterize the scope of a shared
      metadata for the sake of better interoperability should be
      supported.

4.4.  Metadata Granularity

   The packet requirements mentioned above can be broadly classified
   into 2 catagories.

4.4.1.  Application Metadata

   Application metadata comprise of fields in metadata that specifies
   how the application will treat the packet.  This information, when
   available to the network, can be useful in deciding how to handle
   packets during reactive events.  This level of granularity cannot be
   simply replaced by another bit added to the priority field as
   evidenced by the use-case below.

   Requirements: Packet information such as REQ-PACKET-RELIABILITY, REQ-
   PACKET-NATURE as defined above.

   Use-case:

   1.  In an interactive gaming session, the traffic can be of multiple
       types such as critical and smoothening glyph updates for graphics
       traffic, haptic feedback traffic, audio traffic while the game is
       being saved (bulk data).  In terms of priority, haptic feedback
       gets the highest priority and is often transmitted unreliably,
       since getting the feedback late is of minimal use.  While
       considering only priority levels, during an uneventful session,
       haptic feedback would assume highest priority while the
       smoothening glyphs get the lower priority along with bulk data.
       Although, in a loss-prone network, haptic feedback can be dropped
       since it is unreliable while critical glyph and bulk data are
       expected to be delivered reliably and can result in
       retranmissions if lost.  This distinction is not feasible with an
       addition to the priority level but can be done by defining more
       granular metadata.  Information about application's treatment of
       the packet is used by the network in deciding how to handle
       certain types of packets over the other.

4.4.2.  Network Metadata

   Network metadata comprise of fields in metadata that specifies how
   the network should treat the packet.  This dictates how the network
   should prioritize the packet and has no bearing on the nature of the
   packet itself.

   Requirement: Packet handling information such as REQ-PACKET-SELF.

   Use-case:

   1.  In a VoIP session where audio is prioritized over video, both
       traffic has the same nature (reliability and interactivity) and
       differ only in how the packet needs to be prioritized by the
       network to ensure audio reaches more reliably, faster and
       coherently than video.  This is solely the way application wants
       the network to prioritize the packet and not the nature of the
       packet itself.

4.5.  Multiple Bottlenecks

   Whereas models often show a single bottleneck, there are frequently
   two (or more) bottlenecks: the ISP network and within the subscriber
   network (e.g., Wi-Fi link).  As such, all bottlenecks near the
   subscriber should be able to benefit from network/host collaboration.

   Requirement: REQ-MULTIPLE-BOTTLENECKS should be supported.

4.6.  Application Interference

   Applications that have access to a resource-quota information may
   adopt an aggressive behavior (compared to those that don't have
   access) if they assumed that a resource-quota like metadata is for
   the application, not for the host that runs the applications.

   This is challenging for home networks where multiple hosts may be
   running behind the same CPE, with each of them running a video
   application.  The same challenge may apply when tethering is enabled.

   Requirement:

   REQ-SIGNAL-EXPOSURE-FAIRNESS:  Means to expose the signal independent
      of the application should be considered.  An example of such
      exposure is OS APIs.

4.7.  Exposure Handling

   Signaling to the network (Section 5.1, Section 5.2) will need to be
   facilitated by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for any
   application to use them.  Signaling and retrieval of the signals may
   not be performed at a single layer (although not encouraged).  Hence,
   a framework is required to abstract the underlying protocol(s) and
   allow the application(s) to retrieve/send signals using a single or a
   set of API(s) independent of the channels that are used to convey the
   signals.  The API framework is required even if one single channel is
   used so that any application can consume the signals.

   There might be many channels to signal the metadata such as (non-
   exhaustive list):

   *  Application layer

   *  TCP options [RFC9293]

   *  UDP Options [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]

   *  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options (Section 4.3 of [RFC8200])

   *  QUIC CID mapping

   *  ICMP messages

   Requirement:

   REQ-API-FRAMEWORK:  API framework to facilitate signaling for
      applications.

4.8.  Privacy Considerations

   Encrypted media payloads along with temporary IPv6 addresses between
   a server and user (client) provide a measure of privacy for the
   content and the identity of the user.  It should, however, be noted
   that media flows (e.g., encrypted video payloads in SRTP) exhibit a
   pattern of bursts and intervals that amounts to a signature and is
   vulnerable to frequency analysis.  To avoid this kind of frequency
   analysis, media sent by the server would need to be scheduled or
   multiplexed differently to each user/recipient.  This may be possible
   in transports like QUIC which allows flexibility in scheduling each
   stream.  Transports like QUIC also fully encrypt the entire stream
   and, therefore, no media headers are observable on-path either.  The
   security aspects of the media payload / transport are not in the
   scope of this document and is described here only to provide context
   for metadata privacy.

   Some metadata (e.g., the size of a burst of packets, sequence number,
   and timestamp) can be readily observed or inferred by entities along
   the network path.  However, it is essential to recognize that while
   sequence numbers and timestamps are typically visible in the clear-
   text headers of protocols (e.g., TCP, RTP, or SRTP) they are not
   directly observable in encrypted protocols such as QUIC.  All
   metadata sent from the server to the network, including these
   elements and others, are vulnerable to modification while in transit.
   Only an on-path attacker can modify on-path metadata.  Such an
   attacker could engage in other malicious activities, like corrupting
   the checksum or completely dropping the packet.  For instance, an
   active attacker could alter the metadata to mislabel packets
   containing video key-frames as unimportant, but such changes are
   detectable by the receiver.

   It is recommended to encrypt or obfuscate the metadata information so
   it is only available to hosts and to authorized network elements.
   The method of encryption or obfuscation is not described in this
   document but rather in other documents describing how this metadata
   is encoded and exchanged amongst hosts and network elements.  The
   privacy implications of revealing metadata to network elements need
   to be thoroughly analyzed.  This analysis should ensure that any
   exposure of metadata does not compromise user privacy or allow
   unauthorized entities to infer sensitive information about the data
   being transmitted while maintaining minimal resource consumption.

   Requirements:

   REQ-PRIVACY-ADDITIONAL:  An on-path observer obtains no additional
      information about the IP packet.

   REQ-SIGNALING-AVOIDANCE:  Leveraging previous experience [RFC9049],
      the folliwing is not required to make use of the collaborative
      signaling:

      *  Reveal the application identity.

      *  Expose the application cause (or 'reason') to signal metadata.

      *  Reveal server identity.

      *  Inspect client-to-server encrypted payload by network elements.

4.9.  Scalability

   There may be a large number of media flows handled by the server and
   wireless/access router.

   Per flow information (state) at a wireless router for optimizing the
   flow can negate the advantages offered as the number of flows handled
   increases.

   The metadata and other state information that a router has to
   maintain for each additional media flow it handles should be kept to
   a minimum or eliminated altogether.

   Requirement:

   REQ-ISP-SCALE:  The metadata other state information that a wireless
      router has to maintain for each additional media flow it handles
      should be very low or none.

4.10.  Session Continuity

   The general trend in wireless networks is to deploy the wireless
   router closer to the user.  This can help with low link latency but
   can result in more frequent handovers as the user moves between
   routers.  The frequency of handovers increases when a user moves
   faster or when the media session lasts longer.

   During handovers, there should be minimal delay incurred during
   handover in configuring/setting up the metadata of a media session in
   progress.

   Requirement:

   REQ-CONTINUITY:  Handover from one radio or router to another should
      continue to provide same service level.

4.11.  Abuse and Constraints

   It is important that not every flow be prioritized; otherwise, the
   network devolves into the best-effort network that existed prior to
   metadata signaling.  It is a requirement that mechanisms exist to
   prevent this occurrence.

   Such a mechanism might be simple, for example, a cellular network
   might allow one flow from a subscriber to declare itself as
   important; other flows with that subscriber are denied attempts to
   prioritize themselves.  However, the network cannot identify whether
   the prioritized flow is legitimate or malicious.

   Requirements:

   REQ-SIGNAL-VALIDATION:  The network/OS needs to ensure that the user/
      client signaling of priority (if any) does not associate the same
      priority level with all traffic types within the same flow,
      thereby avoiding prioritizing of all the streams/traffic the same
      way.

   REQ-CLIENT-VALIDATION:  The network needs to ensure the signal is
      coming from the same user/client that is part of the 5-tuple flow.
      This is to ensure no other application influences the priority of
      another application's flow.

5.  On-path Metadata Requirements

   There are various approaches for collaborative signaling between the
   server/host and network including out-of-band signaling, client-
   centric metadata sharing and proxied connections.  The requirements
   here focus on proxied metadata connections on path with the data
   traffic.

   The path signals below should follow the principles of intentional
   distribution, protection of information, minimization and limiting
   impact as described in [RFC9419] and [RFC8558].  Leveraging previous
   experience ([RFC9049]), the metadata signals does not need
   application identity, application cause (or 'reason'), server
   identity or the inspection of client(host)-to-server encrypted
   payload.

   The metadata connections may be between server and network (in either
   direction) or between host and network (in either direction).

   Some use cases benefit from server – network metadata exchanges
   (Section 5.2) and others need client involvement (Section 5.1).

   For the requirements that follow, the assumption is that the client
   agrees to the exchange of metadata between the server and network, or
   between the client and network.

5.1.  Host-Network Metadata

5.1.1.  Priority between Flows (Inter-flow)

   Certain flows being received by a host (or by an application on a
   host) are less or more important than other flows of _the same host_.
   For example, a host downloading a software update is generally
   considered less important than another host doing interactive audio/
   video or gaming.

   By signaling the relative importance of flows to a network element,
   the network element can (de-)prioritize those flows to best
   accommodate the needs of the various applications on a same host.  It
   should be noted that these "flows" are identified by UDP 4-tuples and
   belong to the same network attachment of a user.

   Without a signaling in place between a receiving host and its
   network, remote peers are able to mark packets that interfere with
   the desires of the receiving host -- making their flows more
   important than what the receiving host considers more important.
   This eventually causes all flows to be marked as important, or --
   more likely -- such priority markings to be ignored.

   However, prioritizing between flows, even for the same user/
   subscriber, presents the following challenges:

   1.  Identification and authentication of legitimate applications on
       the host.  The remote peers can also be malicious and benign.

   2.  Identifying whether the traffic belongs to a single user or
       multiple users from a single network attachment (e.g., tethering
       or LAN connected to a CPE).  The network will enforce per-
       subscriber policies, not per-host.

   3.  Enforcing fairness to all the flows belonging to a single host.
       For example, it is a challenge to prevent a platform from marking
       certain flows as low priority at platform layer, bypassing the
       application, to (de)prioritize certain applications over all the
       other applications on the same host.  Such unfairness can be
       revealed during certification or public benchmark efforts,
       though.

   Taking into account these challenges, and despite the use case is
   described in the document, inter-flow (de)prioritization requirements
   are out of the scope of this document.

      Future versions of the document may re-consider this conclusion as
      a function of the comments received from the TSVWG.

   Requirements: REQ-FLOW-PRIORITY in Section 3.2 applies here.

5.1.2.  Delay Tolerance between Flows (Inter-flow)

   Some flows are more resilient to buffering and delays (e.g., file
   copy, file download) than others(e.g., interactive traffic).  This
   traffic can be buffered in favor of improved interactivity, without
   significant impact to the user experience.  For example, an on-going
   file copy operation flow (UDP 4-tuple) a remote desktop user can
   tolerate more delay than the flow carrying graphics updates.

   Requirements: REQ-FLOW-DELAY in Section 3.2 applies here.

5.2.  Server-Network Metadata

   Application flows (UDP 4-tuple) for live media, eXtended Reality (XR)
   and gaming require both high bandwidth and low latency and would as
   such benefit from being able to use the bandwidth available for the
   flow.  In wireless networks, some of the bandwidth available for the
   flow is not possible to schedule using the feedback based rate
   control (due to the significant link variations at sub-RTT
   timescales).  In such networks where variations in link quality is
   well below RTT, congestion control algorithms settle to a steady rate
   that avoids excessive packet loss.  Feedback via ECN/L4S [RFC9331]
   provides an accurate signal but is also on an RTT timescale and thus
   does not provide finer resolution information of instantaneous
   bandwidth available.

   If application packets can either tolerate delay or some loss of
   lower priority packets, the network traffic shaper and scheduler can
   use this information to provide a higher application quality of
   service.  For example, video streams contain the occasional key frame
   ("I-frame") containing a full video frame that is necessary to
   rebuild receiver state after loss of delta frames.  The key frames
   are therefore more critical to deliver to the receiver than delta
   frames.  There is some research [_5G-Octopus] to indicate that media
   applications can obtain better measured application quality when
   sending at a higher rate (less conservative than current CCA) and
   allowing the network to delay or drop low priority packets.

   The metadata in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 should also satisfy
   constraints identified in Section 4.  Privacy (Section 4.8) requires
   that metadata should not provide additional information to identify
   the application or the user.  The application server can decide on
   the metadata values that provide the best handling for the packets of
   the flow and may not necessarily reflect the exact priority values
   that allow an on-path observer to perform traffic analysis.  This
   metadata is advisory in nature and network traffic policy
   (Section 4.1) that restricts its use would not result in additional
   issues.  Other constraints including scale (Section 4.9) and
   continuity (Section 4.10) are required for Section 5.2.1 and
   Section 5.2.2.

   Realizing the additional bandwidth potential with these metadata may
   require a higher sending rate for the transport flow.  This requires
   work that is not specified in this document.  Similarly, the
   assumption is that network shapers and schedulers can use the
   metadata in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 but further details are
   out of scope.

   Previous work in [TR.23.700-70-3GPP] has identified the general
   problem in this section.  However, the solution in [TS.23.501-3GPP]
   is specific to a 5G network.  The metadata sent from a (dedicated 5G)
   application server identifies PDU set information and end-of-burst
   signals which are not understood by non-3GPP systems such as Wi-Fi or
   DOCSIS.  Further, 3GPP functions and policy configurations are
   required since this is a 5G specific solution.  The metadata
   disclosed in the 5G solution also identifies frame boundaries and
   does not fully conform to the constraints for privacy or minimality
   of data identified in Section 4.

5.2.1.  Packet Priority

   Per-packet priority information provides the priority level of one
   packet relative to other packets within a transport flow (UDP
   4-tuple).  The application server can decide on the priority or
   importance values that provide the best handling for the packets of
   the transport flow and may not necessarily reflect the exact priority
   values that allow an on-path observer to perform traffic analysis.
   When more than one application stream (e.g., video, audio) is sent on
   the same transport flow, the application server decides the best
   allocation of priority values across the different streams of the
   flow.

   Per-packet priority or importance determines the drop priority of a
   packet.

   Requirements:

   REQ-PACKET-PRIORITY: Packet priority relative to other packets in the
   transport flow (UDP 4-tuple).

5.2.2.  Tolerance to Delay

   Some packets of a media flow (UDP 4-tuple) can tolerate more delay
   over the wire than others (e.g., packets carrying live media frames
   require very low latency while packets carrying a background image
   for augmented reality can tolerate more delay).

   As with per-packet priority in Section 5.2.1, the application server
   can decide on the metadata values that provide the best handling for
   the packets of the transport flow and may not necessarily reflect the
   exact delay tolerance values that allow an on-path observer to
   perform traffic analysis.

   Requirements:

   REQ-PACKET-DELAY: Metadata to indicate whether the packet can
   tolerate delay.

6.  Non-Requirements

   Application feedback with measurements of packets lost and delay
   incurred may affect the sending rate and other behavior of the
   application.  The requirements and specification to mitigate these
   aspects are not in the scope of this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   None.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security aspects for the metadata are discussed in Section 4.8.  The
   principles outlined in [RFC8558], [RFC9049] and [RFC9419] contain
   security considerations and are referenced in Section 5.

   This document has no other security considerations.

Appendix A.  Network Attachment

   A network attachment represents the communication link between hosts
   (client) and network (router) over which a connection policy
   (including QoS) is applied to flows within that network attachment.

   A network attachment may be established using control plane signaling
   between the client and the network (access) router and is out of
   scope of this document.  Transport flows over a network attachment
   may consist of multiple streams such as video or audio.  Figure 3
   shows a high level view of network attachments, flows, and QoS/policy
   discussed in Section 5.

   The requirements in Section 5 apply to data units like frames within
   a flow, but not between flows.  Specifically, this document does not
   discuss flows of distinct hosts/users.

   Figure 3 shows "Client-1" and "Client-2" that negotiate connection
   policy (e.g., QoS) and other aspects like mobility handling, charging
   applied to flows in that network attachment.  "Client-1" has "flow-
   x1" and "flow-x2" over its network attachment while "Client-2" has
   "flow-x3".  The requirements in this document focuses on on-path
   collaboration signals that apply to data units such as media frames
   within flows like "flow-x1/x2/x3" but not between them.
