How will the signaling mechanism between a receiving host and its network prevent a misbehaving remote peer from marking every packet of a flow as import ? \r\n\r\nThe signalling requirement to detect and block such a misuse is not discussed in this section.",

So, *intra* flow priority.\r\n\r\nThe value of signaling from client to the ISP's router is in getting agreement to honor the intra-flow priority values, and getting agreement how they are signaled from server-to-client -- can they be signaled with UDP Options?  Can they be signaled with DSCP?  Can they be signaled with QUIC Connection IDs?  Can they be signaled with RTP/SRTP SSRC?  The ISP router knows what it supports, the client (from discussions with the server) knows what the server supports.  They can find a mutually-agreed-upon signaling mechanism.",

I updated the abstract to have the warning early in the document. Otherwise, we will be opening lot of noise.\r\n\r\nPrioritizing flows from the same host is also error-prone because the network cannot distinguish between legitimate and malicious flows. For example, a poorly written application might request the highest priority for its flows, which could be unjustified. Additionally, it is challenging to identify whether the traffic belongs to a single user or multiple users, such as in tethering scenarios. Therefore, I propose focusing solely on \"intra-flow\" prioritization. Both WebRTC and QUIC, multiplex multiple streams on the same 5-tuple.\r\n\r\n",

Google could do the same with android to promote YouTube performance too... Will this be a concern? Especially if this signal is encrypted and the platform companies have tie ups with ISPs as well as a protocol between them to decrypt the signal, the platform companies could silently kill performance of other small-scale apps...

That way, we got more requirements and use-cases as well to bolster the claim that explicit signaling is required to make things more efficient. There are cases where bulk traffic is also in the same application as interactive traffic (like saving a PPT or printing word file while continuing to type within a remote session (or cloud)). Will that be useful to include these as well in the draft?",

The figure was trying to illustrate the GBR/non-GBR (best effort) sessions in 5G, and be general enough to cover the different cases. \r\n\r\nIn a way, inter-flow priority of sorts is there in the network, but not signaled.\r\nFor example, the problem in Sconepro is that one flow (YouTube) out of many of a non-GBR/ BE session(i.e., has the same signaled connection info between UE - 5G network) is a heavy consumer of bandwidth while other flows in the conn session are not. The flows are all to different servers. The traffic shaper in 5G (UPF) only reduces rate for the high bw user (Youtube) and leaves the others unchanged. My understanding is that Sconepro wants to provide a direct signal as to how the network is constraining that high bw user, i.e., max flow bw. \r\n",

For example, in QUIC, only the connection id and spin bit are not encrypted and neither has meaning for packet priority. It would seem that only the server can indicate if a packet (or frame) has higher priority. ",

There should be a mechanism through which the network should be able to decipher the metadata (getting into the mechanism will be moving into implementation stuff and hence, I didn't get into it here). The metadata will obfuscated/encrypted by the server and the key will be sent to the client over the encrypted channel. The client would then share the key with the network/OS (in band or out of band). This is another use of client-to-network signaling that we had in the document but removed since it goes into implementation details. So left it as a requirement. Implementation would be ideally part of a different draft. Metadata can be filled into the CID for QUIC(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wing-cidfi/) or UDP options or anything else...\r\n\r\nUser/Client would provide a way to decipher the metadata alone and signal \"Hey, treat the packets with metadata b10110 with highest priority\".\r\n\r\nThere would be a <metadata,priority> pair for every flow and not all the metadata should be allowed to have highest priority is what being conveyed here, although how to design that is again getting into implementation part and so I strayed away from it too.",

This would require more than one round trip for server to notice the changed congestion level after the client complains about loss or excessive ECN-marked packets received, requiring the client to then signal the server (via HTTP, updated SDP, or similar).   Why not have the server send packets marked differently the whole time?  Doing so would allow the network to drop less-important packets or forward important packets without suffering the greater-than-one-round-trip (*) delay.\r\n\r\n(*) greater than one round trip because a reasonable client will not react to a single packet loss or single ECN-marked packet, but rather to several.\r\n\r\n\r\nI suggest simply deleting this paragraph starting with \"For example, when the application determines\"\r\n",

Moreover, the collaborative signaling may be enabled so that clients and servers are aware of the network's treatment of incoming packets. Also, client-to-network collaboration can be put in place without revealing the identity of the remote servers. This collaboration allows for differentiated services at the network (e.g., packet discard preference), the sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of server/client and the network.\r\n```",

Maximizing network utilization and end user experience under such conditions is challenging. Factors that affect wireless networks include change in channel conditions, interference between proximate cells, and end user mobility. These variations in link quality can be in the order of a millisecond or less {{5G-Lumos}} while congestion control takes several tens of milliseconds (more than one round-trip time (RTT)) to estimate data rate. Similarly, application servers that encode and serve live or interactive media take time to adjust the encoding level and other processes to match the network rate. End-to-end congestion control algorithms are far from being optimal when the link quality is highly variable in sub-RTT timeframes and the application demands both low latency and high bandwidth (e.g., {{Section 2.1 of ?RFC6077}}). In these conditions, applications settle for a lower throughput when latency is prioritized, or for higher throughput at the expense of much higher delays.\r\n```",

With not fully encrypted packets, networks may use heuristics to build an \"implicit signal\" gleaned from a packet to prioritize or otherwise shape flows. However, implicit signals are not desirable as they lead to ossification of protocols as result of introducing unintended dependencies {{?RFC9419}}. When packet contents are encrypted, the approach of using implicit signals is no longer viable.\r\n```",
