So, *intra* flow priority.\r\n\r\nThe value of signaling from client to the ISP's router is in getting agreement to honor the intra-flow priority values, and getting agreement how they are signaled from server-to-client -- can they be signaled with UDP Options?  Can they be signaled with DSCP?  Can they be signaled with QUIC Connection IDs?  Can they be signaled with RTP/SRTP SSRC?

I updated the abstract to have the warning early in the document. Otherwise, we will be opening lot of noise.\r\n\r\nPrioritizing flows from the same host is also error-prone because the network cannot distinguish between legitimate and malicious flows. For example, a poorly written application might request the highest priority for its flows, which could be unjustified. Additionally, it is challenging to identify whether the traffic belongs to a single user or multiple users, such as in tethering scenarios. Therefore, I propose focusing solely on \"intra-flow\" prioritization. Both WebRTC and QUIC, multiplex multiple streams on the same 5-tuple.\r\n\r\n",

That way, we got more requirements and use-cases as well to bolster the claim that explicit signaling is required to make things more efficient. There are cases where bulk traffic is also in the same application as interactive traffic (like saving a PPT or printing word file while continuing to type within a remote session (or cloud)). Will that be useful to include these as well in the draft?",

The figure was trying to illustrate the GBR/non-GBR (best effort) sessions in 5G, and be general enough to cover the different cases. \r\n\r\nIn a way, inter-flow priority of sorts is there in the network, but not signaled.\r\nFor example, the problem in Sconepro is that one flow (YouTube) out of many of a non-GBR/ BE session(i.e., has the same signaled connection info between UE - 5G network) is a heavy consumer of bandwidth while other flows in the conn session are not. The flows are all to different servers. The traffic shaper in 5G (UPF) only reduces rate for the high bw user (Youtube) and leaves the others unchanged. My understanding is that Sconepro wants to provide a direct signal as to how the network is constraining that high bw user, i.e., max flow bw. \r\n",

Assuming that the e2e flow is encrypted, what would the user/client be able to signal about 'type of traffic within a flow' (i.e., to the network every packet looks the same). For example, in QUIC, only the connection id and spin bit are not encrypted and neither has meaning for packet priority. It would seem that only the server can indicate if a packet (or frame) has higher priority. ",

There should be a mechanism through which the network should be able to decipher the metadata (getting into the mechanism will be moving into implementation stuff and hence, I didn't get into it here). The metadata will obfuscated/encrypted by the server and the key will be sent to the client over the encrypted channel. The client would then share the key with the network/OS (in band or out of band). This is another use of client-to-network signaling that we had in the document but removed since it goes into implementation details. So left it as a requirement. Implementation would be ideally part of a different draft. Metadata can be filled into the CID for QUIC(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wing-cidfi/) or UDP options or anything else...\r\n\r\nUser/Client would provide a way to decipher the metadata alone and signal \"Hey, treat the packets with metadata b10110 with highest priority\".\r\n\r\nThere would be a <metadata,priority> pair for every flow and not all the metadata should be allowed to have highest priority is what being conveyed here, although how to design that is again getting into implementation part and so I strayed away from it too.",
