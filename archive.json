How will the signaling mechanism between a receiving host and its network prevent a misbehaving remote peer from marking every packet of a flow as import ? \r\n\r\nThe signalling requirement to detect and block such a misuse is not discussed in this section.",

So, *intra* flow priority.\r\n\r\nThe value of signaling from client to the ISP's router is in getting agreement to honor the intra-flow priority values, and getting agreement how they are signaled from server-to-client -- can they be signaled with UDP Options?  Can they be signaled with DSCP?  Can they be signaled with QUIC Connection IDs?  Can they be signaled with RTP/SRTP SSRC?

I updated the abstract to have the warning early in the document. Otherwise, we will be opening lot of noise.\r\n\r\nPrioritizing flows from the same host is also error-prone because the network cannot distinguish between legitimate and malicious flows. For example, a poorly written application might request the highest priority for its flows, which could be unjustified. Additionally, it is challenging to identify whether the traffic belongs to a single user or multiple users, such as in tethering scenarios. Therefore, I propose focusing solely on \"intra-flow\" prioritization. Both WebRTC and QUIC, multiplex multiple streams on the same 5-tuple.\r\n\r\n",

Google could do the same with android to promote YouTube performance too... Will this be a concern? Especially if this signal is encrypted and the platform companies have tie ups with ISPs as well as a protocol between them to decrypt the signal, the platform companies could silently kill performance of other small-scale apps...

The figure was trying to illustrate the GBR/non-GBR (best effort) sessions in 5G, and be general enough to cover the different cases. \r\n\r\nIn a way, inter-flow priority of sorts is there in the network, but not signaled.\r\nFor example, the problem in Sconepro is that one flow (YouTube) out of many of a non-GBR/ BE session(i.e., has the same signaled connection info between UE - 5G network) is a heavy consumer of bandwidth while other flows in the conn session are not. The flows are all to different servers. The traffic shaper in 5G (UPF) only reduces rate for the high bw user (Youtube) and leaves the others unchanged. My understanding is that Sconepro wants to provide a direct signal as to how the network is constraining that high bw user, i.e., max flow bw. \r\n",

The metadata will obfuscated/encrypted by the server and the key will be sent to the client over the encrypted channel. The client would then share the key with the network/OS (in band or out of band). This is another use of client-to-network signaling that we had in the document but removed since it goes into implementation details. So left it as a requirement. Implementation would be ideally part of a different draft. Metadata can be filled into the CID for QUIC(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wing-cidfi/) or UDP options or anything else...\r\n\r\nUser/Client would provide a way to decipher the metadata alone and signal \"Hey, treat the packets with metadata b10110 with highest priority\".\r\n\r\nThere would be a <metadata,priority> pair for every flow and not all the metadata should be allowed to have highest priority is what being conveyed here, although how to design that is again getting into implementation part and so I strayed away from it too.",

Hence, a framework is required to abstract the underlying protocol(s) and allow the application(s) to retrieve/send signals using a single or a set of API(s) independent of the channels that are used to convey the signals.
