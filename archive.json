Eventually, when all packets of every flow are marked as important, there is no differentiation between packets within a flow, rendering the network unable to improve reactive policy decisions.\r\n\r\nComment> The above text is not clear to me. How will the signaling mechanism between a receiving host and its network prevent a misbehaving remote peer from marking every packet of a flow as import ? \r\n\r\nThe signalling requirement to detect and block such a misuse is not discussed in this section.",

But we have agreed to constrain the I-D to discuss only priority of packets within a single flow (that is, within a 5-tuple).  So, *intra* flow priority.\r\n\r\nThe value of signaling from client to the ISP's router is in getting agreement to honor the intra-flow priority values, and getting agreement how they are signaled from server-to-client -- can they be signaled with UDP Options?  Can they be signaled with DSCP?  Can they be signaled with QUIC Connection IDs?  Can they be signaled with RTP/SRTP SSRC?  The ISP router knows what it supports, the client (from discussions with the server) knows what the server supports.  They can find a mutually-agreed-upon signaling mechanism.",

It is a requirement that mechanisms exist to prevent this occurrence.\r\n\r\nSuch a mechanism might be simple, for example, a cellular network might allow one flow from a subscriber to declare itself as important; other flows with that subscriber are denied attempts to prioritize themselves.\r\n\r\nComment> The network cannot identify whether the prioritized flow is legitimate or malicious. It has no info to detect malicious flows, if several flows mark themselves as important. I don't think prioritizing a flow over others is in the scope of this draft.",
