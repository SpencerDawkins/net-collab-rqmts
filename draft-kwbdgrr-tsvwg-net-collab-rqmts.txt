            Requirements for Network Collaboration Signaling
              draft-kwbdgrr-tsvwg-net-collab-rqmts-latest

Abstract

   Wireless networks (e.g., cellular or WLAN) experience significant but
   transient variations in link quality and have policy constraints
   (e.g., bandwidth) that affect user experience.  Collaborative
   signaling (e.g., host-to-network and server-to-network) can improve
   the user experience by informing the network about the the nature and
   relative importance of packets (frames, streams, etc.) without having
   to disclose the content of the packets.  Moreover, the collaborative
   signalling may be enabled so that hosts are aware of the network's
   treatment of incoming packets.  Also, host-to-network collaboration
   can be put in place without revealing the identity of the remote
   servers.  This collaboration allows for differentiated services at
   the network (e.g., packet discard preference), the sender (e.g.,
   adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of server / host and
   the network.

   This document lists some use cases that demonstrate the need for a
   mechanism to share metadata and outlines requirements for both
   server-to-network (and vice versa) and host-to-network (and vice
   versa).  The document focuses on intra-flow or flows bound to the
   same user.

1.  Introduction

   Wireless networks inherently experience large variations in link
   quality due to several factors.  These include the change in wireless
   channel conditions, interference between proximate cells and channels
   or because of the end user movement.  These variations in link
   quality can be in the order of a millisecond or less [_5G-Lumos]
   while congestion control takes several tens of milliseconds (more
   than one RTT) to estimate data rate.  End-to-end congestion control
   algorithms are far from optimal when the link quality is highly
   variable in sub-RTT timeframes and the application demands both low
   latency and high bandwidth.

   It is also not practical to convey sub-RTT link changes using an end-
   to-end feedback signal.  As a consequence, applications settling for
   a lower throughput when latency is prioritized or achieving higher
   throughput at the expense of much higher delays.

   With not fully encrypted packets, networks may used some heuristics
   to build an "implicit signal" derived from the contents of a packet
   to prioritize or otherwise shape flows.  Implicit signals are not
   desirable as they leads to ossification of protocols as result of
   introducing unintended dependencies [RFC9419].  When packet contents
   are encrypted, the approach of using implicit signals is no longer
   viable.

   Bandwidth constraints exist most predominantly at the access network
   (e.g., radio access networks).  Users who are serviced via these
   networks use hosts which run various application clients; each having
   different connectivity needs for an optimal user experience.  These
   needs are not frozen but change over time depending on the
   application and even depending on how an application is used (e.g.,
   user's preferences).  An explicit signal to the host can help to
   manage the use of available bandwidth better and better share it with
   requesting applications.

   Other applications like interactive media can demand both high
   throughput and low latency and, in some cases, carry different media
   streams (e.g., audio and video) in a single transport connection
   (e.g., WebRTC [RFC8825]).  There may be preferences that an
   application may wish to convey, such as a higher priority for audio
   over video (or the opposite) in congested networks.  With RTP
   [RFC3550], the type of media could be examined and used as an
   implicit signal for determining relative priority.  However,
   [RFC9335] defines a new mechanism that completely encrypts RTP header
   extensions and Contributing sources (CSRCs).  Furthermore, a full
   encrypted transport (e.g., QUIC [RFC9000]) does not expose any media
   header information that on-path network elements can use for
   forwarding.

   Also, traffic patterns in some emerging applications can vary
   significantly during the session.  For example, live media or AI-
   generated content can have significant dynamic variations and
   potentially aperiodic frames.  Information in unencrypted media
   packets and headers that wireless networks have used to optimize
   traffic shaping and scheduling are not exposed in encrypted
   communications.

                                  Figure 1

   Figure 1 shows where such bandwidth and performance constraints
   usually exist with a “B” (for Bottleneck) in 3GPP/mobile networks and
   WLAN/ISP networks.  When a bottleneck exists temporarily, the network
   has no choice but to discard or delay packets -- which can harm
   certain flows and, thus, lead to suboptimal perceived experience.  In
   this document, this is termed 'reactive policy'.

   A network attachment represents the communication link between hosts
   (client) and network (router) over which a connection policy
   (including QoS) is applied to flows within that network attachment.

   A network attachment may be established using control plane signaling
   between the client and the network (access) router and is out of
   scope of this document.  Transport flows over a network attachment
   may consist of multiple streams such as video or audio.  Figure 2
   shows a high level view of network attachments, flows, and QoS/policy
   discussed in Section 4.

   The requirements in Section 4 apply to data units like frames within
   a flow, but not between flows.  Specifically, this document does not
   discuss flows of distinct hosts/users.

   Figure 2 shows "Client-1" and "Client-2" that negotiate connection
   policy (e.g., QoS) and other aspects like mobility handling, charging
   applied to flows in that network attachment.  "Client-1" has "flow-
   x1" and "flow-x2" over its network attachment while "Client-2" has
   "flow-x3".  The requirements in this document focuses on on-path
   media collaboration signals that apply to data units such as media
   frames within flows like "flow-x1/x2/x3" but not between them.

   In summary, the rapid variation of wireless link quality and/or
   bandwidth limitations in networks along with interactive applications
   that demand low latency and high throughput can lead to suboptimal
   user experience.  Section 2 outlines use cases to illustrate the
   issues and the need for additional information per flow to allow the
   network to optimize its handling.

   Section 3 provides operational constraints in the network and
   Section 4 describes the requirements for on-path media collaboration
   signals.

1.1.  Definitions

   The document makes use of the following terms:

   Intentional Management:  Network policy such as (monthly) bandwidth
      quota or bandwidth limit, or quality (delay and/or jitter))
      assurances.

   Reactive Management:  Network reactions to congestion events or
      protection polices under attacks, with very short to very long
      durations (e.g., varying wireless and mobile air interface
      conditions).

   Traffic shaping:  Refers in this document to QoS management at the
      wireless/access router to delay or discard packets of lower
      priority to achieve bounded latency and high throughput.

   User Plane Function (UPF):  Refers to a 3GPP element that is located
      between the mobile infrastructure and the Data Network (DN) as
      shown in Figure 3.

      For a definitive description of 3GPP network architectures, the
      reader should refer to the 3GPP's TR 23.501 [TR.23.501-3GPP].

2.  Use Cases

2.1.  Media Streaming

   Streaming video contains the occasional key frame ("I-frame")
   containing a full video frame.  These frames are necessary to rebuild
   receiver state after loss of delta frames.  The key frames are
   therefore more critical to deliver to the receiver than delta frames.

   Streaming video also contains audio frames which can be encoded
   separately and, thus, can be signaled separately (requirement: REQ-
   MEDIA-KEYFRAME).

   Audio is more critical than video for many applications, but its
   importance (relative to other packets in the flow) is still an
   application decision (requirements: REQ-MEDIA-AV-SEPARATE, REQ-MEDIA-
   CLIENT-DECIDES).  For example, the ability of the receiver to change
   the priority by communicating to the network -- without cooperation
   of the sender -- gives a hearing-impaired user the ability to adjust
   video above audio.

   Especially with media over QUIC, the server (or relay) sends the same
   stream to many receivers, including the same metadata.  Thus, when a
   client needs different prioritization (e.g., video over audio or the
   other way around), this is only achievable by signaling that priority
   inversion from the client to the ISP router (requirement: REQ-CLIENT-
   DECIDES).

   Examples: live broadcast, on-demand video streaming

   REQ-MEDIA-KEYFRAME: Video contains partial frames and full frames,
   which need to be distinguished so that full frames can be indicated
   to the network.

   REQ-MEDIA-AV-SEPARATE: Audio can be prioritized differently than
   video.

2.2.  Interactive Media

   Interactive media includes content that a user can actively engage
   with and results in input and response actions that can be highly
   delay-sensitive.  It also includes mixed traffic where both bulk and
   interactive data are exchanged within the same flow.  They may
   include digital models of the real world, multimedia content,
   virtualized desktop/apps, and interactive engagement.

   Examples: VoIP (Peer-to-Peer (P2P), group conferencing), gaming,
   eXtended Reality (XR), Virtual Apps and Desktops.

   REQ-INTERACTIVE: The receiver indicates that a flow is interactive
   and requests that the network honors the incoming flow's per-packet
   signals, which prevents denial of service of mis-marked incoming
   flows.

2.3.  User Preferences

   A game or VoIP application may want to signal different metadata for
   the same type of packet in each direction.  For example, for a game,
   video in the server-to-client direction might be more important than
   audio, whereas input devices (e.g., keystrokes) might be more
   important than audio.  Each user can have varied preferences for the
   same type of data originating from the server.

   Determination of such preferences is outside of the scope of this
   document.

   Requirements: REQ-CLIENT-DECIDES: The receiving client determines
   importance of packets it receives, as the client may have changing
   needs over time.

2.4.  Honoring of Metadata for Servers Behind a Gateway

   In enterprise networks and remote desktop use case, a server can host
   multiple connections with varying type of traffic.  These servers are
   often exposed to the Internet through some sort of a gateway-proxy
   and the signaling (like DSCP bits) from these servers are often
   ignored by the access/transit networks.

   Requirements: REQ-CLIENT-DECIDES as defined previously.

3.  Operational Considerations

   Traffic policing and shaping are enforced in ingress/egress network
   points for various reasons (protect the network against attacks,
   ensure conformance with a trafic profile, etc.).  Out-of-profile
   trafic may be discarded or assigned another class (e.g., using Lower
   Effort Per-Domain Behavior (LE PDB) [RFC3662]) a bandwidth limit
   among others.  The exact behavior is policy-based and deployment-
   specific.

   The entire set of operations to manage traffic is beyond the scope of
   this document.  This section focuses on operational constraints that
   impact server – network, and host – network modes of sending
   metadata.

3.1.  Policy Enforcement

   Some metadata requires the network to share some hints with a host to
   adjust its behavior for some specific flows.  However, that metadata
   may have a dependency on the service offering that is subscribed by a
   user.

   Let us consider the example of a bitrate for an optimized video
   delivery. _Such bitrate may not be computed system-wide_ given that
   flows from users with distinct service offerings (and connectivity
   SLOs) may be serviced by the same network nodes.  Instead, the
   network needs to dynamically adjust the bitrate based on each user's
   service package and connectivity SLOs to ensure optimal delivery for
   all users (REQ-METADATA-ACCURACY).

   Requirement: REQ-METADATA-ACCURACY.

3.2.  Redundant Functions and Classification Complications

   If distinct channels are used to share the metadata between a host
   and a network, a network that engages in the collaborative signaling
   approach will require sophisticated features to classify flows and
   decide which channel is used to share metadata so that it can consume
   that information.

   Likewise, the network will require to implement redundant functions;
   for each signaling interface.

   _As such, application- and protocol-specific signaling channels are
   suboptimal._ (REQ-SINGLE-CHANNEL)

   Requirement: REQ-SINGLE-CHANNEL is preferred.

3.3.  Metadata Scope

   An operational challenge for sharing resource-quota like metadata
   (e.g., maximum bitrate) is that the network is generally not entitled
   to allocate quota per-application, per-flow, per-stream, etc. that
   delivered as part of an Internet connectivity service.  However, the
   network has a visibility about the overall network attachment (e.g.
   inbound/outbound bandwidth discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit]).

   As such, hints about resource-like metadata is bound by default to
   the overall network attachment, not specific to a given application
   or flow.

   Most importantly, the metadata can be used by the network to
   prioritize traffic within a single 5-tuple connection and metadata
   cannot be leveraged for prioritization between different flows.

   It is out of the scope of this document to discuss setups (e.g., 3GPP
   PDU Sessions) where network attachments with Guaranteed Bit Rate
   (GBR) for specific flows is provided.

   Requirement: REQ-SCOPED-METADATA: Means to characterize the scope of
   a shared metadata for the sake of better interoperability should be
   supported.

3.4.  Application Interference

   Applications that have access to a resource-quota information may
   adopt an aggressive behavior (compared to those that don't have
   access) if they assumed that a resource-quota like metadata is for
   the application, not for the host that runs the applications.

   This is challenging for home networks where multiple hosts may be
   running behind the same CPE, with each of them running a video
   application.  The same challenge may apply when tethering is enabled.

   Requirement: REQ-SIGNAL-EXPOSURE-FAIRNESS: Means to expose the signal
   independent of the application should be considered.

3.5.  Privacy Considerations

   Encrypted media payloads along with temporary IPv6 addresses between
   a server and user (client) provide a measure of privacy for the
   content and the identity of the user.  It should however be noted
   that media flows (e.g., encrypted video payloads in SRTP) exhibit a
   pattern of bursts and intervals that amounts to a signature and is
   vulnerable to frequency analysis.  To avoid this kind of frequency
   analysis, media sent by the server would need to be scheduled or
   multiplexed differently to each user/recipient.  This may be possible
   in transports like QUIC which allows flexibility in scheduling each
   stream.  Transports like QUIC also fully encrypt the entire stream
   and therefore no media headers are observable on path either.  The
   security aspects of the media payload/ transport are not in the scope
   of these requirements and is described here only to provide context
   for metadata privacy.

   Privacy considerations for the metadata itself should ensure that no
   additional information about the content is disclosed to the network,
   and no information about the user of the content is disclosed to the
   network or server.

   Some metadata (e.g., the size of a burst of packets, sequence number,
   and timestamp) can be readily observed or inferred by entities along
   the network path.  However, it is essential to recognize that while
   sequence numbers and timestamps are typically visible in the clear-
   text headers of protocols (e.g., TCP, RTP, or SRTP) they are not
   directly observable in encrypted protocols such as QUIC.  All
   metadata sent from the server to the wireless router, including these
   elements and others, are vulnerable to modification while in transit.
   Only an on-path attacker can modify on-path metadata.  Such an
   attacker could engage in other malicious activities, like corrupting
   the checksum or completely dropping the packet.  For instance, an
   active attacker could alter the metadata to mislabel packets
   containing video key-frames as unimportant, but such changes are
   detectable by the receiver.  The privacy implications of revealing
   metadata to network elements need to be thoroughly analyzed.  This
   analysis should ensure that any exposure of metadata does not
   compromise user privacy or allow unauthorized entities to infer
   sensitive information about the data being transmitted.

   Requirement: REQ-PRIVACY-ADDITIONAL: An on-path observer obtains no
   additional information about the IP packet.

3.6.  Scalability

   There may be a large number of media flows handled by the server and
   wireless/access router.

   Per flow information (state) at a wireless router for optimizing the
   flow can negate the advantages offered as the number of flows handled
   increases.

   The metadata and other state information that a router has to
   maintain for each additional media flow it handles should be kept to
   a minimum or eliminated altogether.

   Requirement: REQ-ISP-SCALE: The metadata other state information that
   a wireless router has to maintain for each additional media flow it
   handles should be very low or none.

3.7.  Session Continuity

   The general trend in wireless networks is to deploy the wireless
   router closer to the user.  This can help with low link latency but
   can result in more frequent handovers as the user moves between
   routers.  The frequency of handovers increases when a user moves
   faster or when the media session lasts longer.

   During handovers, there should be minimal delay incurred during
   handover in configuring/setting up the metadata of a media session in
   progress.

   Requirement: REQ-CONTINUITY: Handover from one radio or router to
   another should continue to provide same service level.

3.8.  Abuse and Constraints

   It is important that not every flow be prioritized; otherwise, the
   network devolves into the best-effort network that existed prior to
   metadata signaling.  It is a requirement that mechanisms exist to
   prevent this occurrence.

   Such a mechanism might be simple, for example, a cellular network
   might allow one flow from a subscriber to declare itself as
   important; other flows with that subscriber are denied attempts to
   prioritize themselves.  However, the network cannot identify whether
   the prioritized flow is legitimate or malicious.

   Requirement: REQ-??: _need text here_

4.  On-path Metadata Requirements

   There are various approaches for collaborative signaling between the
   server/host and network including out-of-band signaling, client-
   centric metadata sharing and proxied connections.  The requirements
   here focus on proxied metadata connections on path with the data
   traffic.

   The path signals below should follow the principles of intentional
   distribution, protection of information, minimization and limiting
   impact as described in [RFC9419] and [RFC8558].  Leveraging previous
   experience ([RFC9049]), the metadata signals does not need
   application identity, application cause (or 'reason'), server
   identity or the inspection of client(host)-to-server encrypted
   payload.

   The metadata connections may be between server and network (in either
   direction) or between host and network (in either direction).

   Some use cases benefit from server – network metadata exchanges
   (Section 4.1) and others need client involvement (Section 4.2).

   For the requirements that follow, the assumption is that the client
   agrees to the exchange of metadata between the server and network, or
   between the client and network.

   REQ-PACKET-SELF: Packet importance is indicated by the packet itself,
   which may need to be decrypted or de-obfuscated.

4.1.  Server-Network Metadata

4.1.1.  Identification of Media Frames and Streams

   Feedback provided by ECN/L4S to the server (UDP sender) is not fast
   enough to adjust the sending rate when available wireless capacity
   changes significantly in very short periods of time (~ 1
   millisecond).  Differentiating using multiple DSCP codes does not
   provide the resolution required to classify media frames or streams
   and adapt to changes in coding due to dynamic content or resulting
   from network conditions.

   Relative priority and tolerance to delay of media frames or streams
   can be used to optimize traffic shaping at the wireless router.  The
   application can provide information to detect the start, end and set
   of packets that belong to a media frame.  Alternatively, the
   application may provide information to identify one stream of the
   flow from another.  The application provides information to identify
   either media frames or streams in a flow but not both.

   In cases where the wireless network has to drop or delay processing,
   all packets of the media frame or stream are treated in the same
   manner.

   Requirements:

   REQ-FRAME-START: Indicate packet containing start of media frame.

   REQ-FRAME-MIDDLE: Indicate packet containing middle(s) of media
   frame.

   REQ-FRAME-END: Indicate packet containing end of media frame.

4.1.2.  Relative Priority

   Relative importance of a media frame provides the priority level of
   one media frame over another media frame within a stream.  The
   application server determines the importance based on the media
   encoded in the media frame (e.g., a base layer video I-frame has
   higher priority than an enhanced layer P-frame).  Importance may be
   used to determine drop priority of a media frame in cases of extreme
   congestion in the wireless network.

   Relative importance of a media stream is the priority level of one
   media stream over another stream in the flow (with the same IP
   5-tuple).  As with media frames, importance may be used to determine
   drop priority in cases of extreme congestion in the wireless network.

   There is no requirement associated with this use-case.

4.1.3.  Tolerance to Delay

   Some media frames may be able to tolerate more delay over the wire
   than others (e.g., live media frames require very low latency while a
   background image for augmented reality may be delivered with more
   delay tolerance).  Similarly, some media streams can tolerate more
   delay over the wire than others (e.g., a stream carrying a background
   image may tolerate more delay). ams may be able to tolerate more
   delay over the wire than others (e.g., a stream carrying a background
   image for augmented reality may be delivered with more delay
   tolerance).  Even when the media payload is not encrypted, the
   network has no means to distinguish these different requirements.

   If the application can indicate that a media frame or stream can
   tolerate high delay the wireless router can opt to delay packets
   rather than drop during transient congestion periods.

   REQ-DELAY-TOLERANCE: ??  How is this different from three sections
   earlier??

4.1.4.  Burst Indication

   Media flows can have large and unexpected variations in packet bursts
   due to dynamic changes in content, server estimation of network
   conditions and pacing behavior.  Encoding of live video, and
   multimodal media can only increase the burst size that a server has
   to contend with sending out in a relative smoothed out manner.  The
   burst size is observable on the wire, but can only be determined by
   the end of the burst of packets.  Wireless networks on the other hand
   cannot reserve resources for the maximum burst size allowed as that
   will likely lead to poor utilization of radio resources or tail
   drops.

   The server may provide burst size at the beginning of the burst to
   allow the scheduler to reserve sufficient resources (and avoid having
   too few resources that may lead to a tail drop).  The server may also
   signal end of burst that provides information for the radio to go
   into sleep mode (Connected Mode Discontinuous Reception, C-DRX) if
   there is no paging message.

   REQ-BURST-INDICATOR: Client indicates this flow's maximum burst to
   ISP, and ISP agrees it can handle that burst size.  (but what does
   ISP router do with the burst?  Needs to be described above!)

4.2.  Host-Network Metadata

4.2.1.  Priority between Flows (Inter-flow)

   Certain flows being received by a host (or by an application on a
   host) are less or more important than other flows of _the same host_.
   For example, a host downloading a software update is generally
   considered less important than another host doing interactive audio/
   video or gaming.  By signaling the relative importance of flows to a
   network element, the network element can (de-)prioritize those flows
   to best accommodate the needs of the various applications on a same
   host.

   Without a signaling in place between a receiving host and its
   network, remote peers are able to mark packets that interfere with
   the desires of the receiving host -- making their flows more
   important than what the receiving host considers more important.
   This eventually causes all flows to be marked as important, or --
   more likely -- such priority markings to be ignored.

   However, prioritizing between flows presents challenges because the
   host can have both malicious and legitimate applications, and the
   remote peers can also be malicious and benign.

   There is no requirement associated with this use-case.

4.2.2.  Priority within a Flow (Intra-Flow)

   Interactive Audio/Video has long been using [RFC3550] which runs over
   UDP.  As described in Section 2.3.7.2 of [RFC7478], there is value in
   differentiating between voice, video and data.  Today's video
   streaming is exclusively over TCP but will migrate to QUIC and
   eventually is likely to support unreliable transport ([RFC9221],
   [I-D.ietf-moq-transport]).  With unreliable transport of video in RTP
   or QUIC, it is beneficial to differentiate the important video
   keyframes from other video frames.  Other applications such as gaming
   and remote desktop also benefit from differentiating their packets to
   the network.

   Many of these flows do not originate from a content provider's
   network -- rather, they originate from a peer (e.g., VoIP,
   interactive video, peer-to-peer gaming, Remote Desktop, CDN).  Thus,
   the flows originate from an IP address that is not known before
   connection establishment, so there needs to be a way for the client
   to authorize the network elements to receive and hopefully to honor
   the metadata of those packets from a remote peer.

   Without a signaling in place between a receiving host and its
   network, remote peers are able to mark every packet of a flow as
   important, causing much the same problem as the previous use-case.
   Eventually, when all packets of every flow are marked as important,
   there is no differentiation between packets within a flow, rendering
   the network unable to improve reactive policy decisions.

   REQ-INTERACTIVE: ??  Is this same as REQ-INTERACTIVE (above) ??

5.  Non-Requirements

   Application feedback with measurements of packets lost and delay
   incurred may affect the sending rate and other behavior of the
   application.  The requirements and specification to mitigate these
   aspects are not in the scope of this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   None.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security aspects for the metadata are discussed in Section 3.5.  The
   principles outlined in [RFC8558], [RFC9049] and [RFC9419] contain
   security considerations and are referenced in Section 4.

   This document has no other security considerations.

Acknowledgments

   Xavier De Foy and the authors of this draft have discussed the
   similarities and differences of this draft with the MoQ draft for
   carrying media metadata.

   The authors wish to thank Mike Heard, Sebastian Moeller and Tom
   Herbert for discussions on metadata fields, fragmentation and various
   transport aspects.

   The authors appreciate input from Marcus Ilhar and Magnus Westerlund
   on the need to address privacy in general and Dan Druta to consider a
   common transport across various host to network signaling when
   possible.  Ruediger Geib suggested that limiting the amount of state
   information that a wireless router has to keep for a flow should be
   minimized.

   Ingemar Johansson's suggestions on fast fading (which L4S handles)
   and dramatic drops in wireless accesses have been helpful to identify
   the issues.  Thanks to Hang Shi for the review and comments on host-
   to-network signaling.
